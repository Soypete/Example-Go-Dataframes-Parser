Nicholas Bell\u2019s essay details the longstanding use of traditional fibers, such as black ash, white oak, willow, and sweetgrass and the perseverance of a select few to harvest these elements\u2014the land itself\u2014for the enrichment of daily life. Drawing on conversations with basketmakers from across the country and reproducing many of their documentary photographs, Bell offers an intimate glimpse of their lifeways, motivations, and hopes. Lavish illustrations of every basket in the exhibition convey the humble, tactile beauty of these functional vessels.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca class=\u0022btn btn-default\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/www.1shoppingcart.com\/SecureCart\/SecureCart.aspx?mid=86E5CC82-F584-4262-84F3-C331DD7228A1\u0026amp;pid=bcc81f9fa5b243489235c803d817007a\u0022\u003EAdd to Cart\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;Hardcover,\u0026nbsp;\u003Cstrike\u003E$50.00\u003C\/strike\u003E\u0026nbsp;$35.00\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\n","summary":""},"book_title_display":"A Measure of the Earth: The Cole-Ware Collection of American Baskets","dimensions":"9 3\/4 x 11 1\/4 in.","isbn_hardcover":"978-1-4696-1528-8","isbn_softcover":null,"pages":"192 pp.: Ill (174 color, 5 black-and-white)","publisher":null,"year_published":2013},"relationships":{"field_curators":{"data":[],"links":{"self":"https:\/\/api.si.edu\/saam\/v1\/books\/0a322454-a02e-4752-963b-bbae0b58c47d\/relationships\/field_curators"}},"exhibition_codes":{"data":[],"links":{"self":"https:\/\/api.si.edu\/saam\/v1\/books\/0a322454-a02e-4752-963b-bbae0b58c47d\/relationships\/exhibition_codes"}},"images":{"data":[{"type":"images","id":"b9575d3d-efc6-4804-ad5c-237404ec8dee"}],"links":{"self":"https:\/\/api.si.edu\/saam\/v1\/books\/0a322454-a02e-4752-963b-bbae0b58c47d\/relationships\/images"}}},"links":{"self":"https:\/\/api.si.edu\/saam\/v1\/books\/0a322454-a02e-4752-963b-bbae0b58c47d"}},{"type":"books","id":"434b5a8f-588d-425c-929a-0a0393eaaa9d","attributes":{"uuid":"434b5a8f-588d-425c-929a-0a0393eaaa9d","title":"Skilled Work : American Craft in the Renwick Gallery","changed":"2017-09-03T21:02:09-0400","path":{"alias":"\/books\/skilled-work","pid":573938,"langcode":"en"},"author":"Trapp","author_for_display":"Kenneth R.

Wendell Garrett brings his broad knowledge of decorative arts and folk art to bear, placing Cunningham in the context of ideas and events. Virginia Mecklenburg, senior curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, traces Cunningham\u2019s life and situates his work in the context of the folk art revival that brought Edward Hicks, Grandma Moses, and Horace Pippin to national attention. Carolyn Weekly, director of museums at Colonial Williamsburg, shows how Cunningham\u2019s style developed over the course of his career.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca class=\u0022btn btn-default\u0022 href=\u0022http:\/\/www.1shoppingcart.com\/SecureCart\/SecureCart.aspx?mid=86E5CC82-F584-4262-84F3-C331DD7228A1\u0026amp;pid=5cb43061f8c51ff7ecc099477d83f272\u0022\u003EAdd to Cart\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;Hardcover, $45.00\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\n","summary":""},"book_title_display":"Earl Cunningham\u0027s America","dimensions":"12 x 10 in.","isbn_hardcover":"978-1-58834-248-5","isbn_softcover":null,"pages":"143 pp: ill (72 color)","publisher":null,"year_published":2007},"relationships":{"field_curators":{"data":[],"links":{"self":"https:\/\/api.si.edu\/saam\/v1\/books\/384dd750-678e-4508-8de6-0e43088fb32a\/relationships\/field_curators"}},"exhibition_codes":{"data":[],"links":{"self":"https:\/\/api.si.edu\/saam\/v1\/books\/384dd750-678e-4508-8de6-0e43088fb32a\/relationships\/exhibition_codes"}},"images":{"data":[{"type":"images","id":"3beb3b59-b23a-456b-b74c-34a3dd96605f"}],"links":{"self":"https:\/\/api.si.edu\/saam\/v1\/books\/384dd750-678e-4508-8de6-0e43088fb32a\/relationships\/images"}}},"links":{"self":"https:\/\/api.si.edu\/saam\/v1\/books\/384dd750-678e-4508-8de6-0e43088fb32a"}},{"type":"books","id":"4f648b53-3fb5-4d6d-9c0c-fabfb018e79a","attributes":{"uuid":"4f648b53-3fb5-4d6d-9c0c-fabfb018e79a","title":"Telling Stories: Norman Rockwell from the Collections of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg","changed":"2018-08-22T10:55:45-0400","path":{"alias":"\/books\/rockwell","pid":574811,"langcode":"en"},"author":null,"author_for_display":"Virginia Mecklenburg with Todd McCarthy","description":{"value":"\u003Cp\u003ENorman Rockwell\u2019s pictures tell stories\u2014of children growing up and of couples growing old\u2014that make us laugh with warmhearted recognition.
