New innovations and ideas play a crucial role in creating American jobs, stimulating our economy, and remaining globally competitive.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd it was two years ago today that the president signed the America Invents Act (AIA) into law, setting in motion the most significant changes to the U.S. patent system since 1836. In just two years, the United States Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s (USPTO) implementation of AIA has contributed to a more internationally harmonized, more predictable, and more flexible patent system for the United States, and one that is much more responsive to 21st century realities.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUSPTO Deputy Director Teresa Stanek Rea marked the anniversary during a public forum at USPTO\u2019s headquarters in Alexandria, Va., today. The meeting served as an opportunity to bring stakeholders together with USPTO experts to address and answers questions on AIA provisions.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the biggest change to the patent laws was the transition from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-inventor-to-file\u201d system. This change better aligns U.S. patent law with other patent systems throughout the world. It also simplifies the process of acquiring rights while also supporting innovators\u2014both large and small\u2014as they acquire venture capital, begin manufacturing their innovations, and seek out both domestic and foreign markets.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe AIA also provided the USPTO with tools to facilitate faster processing of patent applications. The USPTO\u2019s Track One program helps decrease application pendency by giving inventors a fast track to a final decision. It currently averages a six months for the entire process, compared to an overall total pendency of 29.5 months for patent applications not filed through the program.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPatent quality will also continue to improve with the \u201cpre-issuance submission\u201d provision in the AIA, which allows third parties to submit prior art. Resolving disputes about patent rights earlier in the process, with greater efficiency and less cost, adds greater certainty to the American patent system.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe America Invents Act also called for the creation of satellite offices outside of the Washington, DC area to better serve the needs of entrepreneurs nationwide. The USPTO has opened temporary satellite spaces in Dallas, Denver, and Silicon Valley\u2014all of them staffed with Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) judges working to reduce an inventory of appeal cases. A permanent office also opened in Detroit in July 2012, with both PTAB judges and patent examiners hard at work.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of the day, partnerships, quality service, and frequent stakeholder engagement and input are what make the Department of Commerce\u2019s USPTO a successful agency.

Missoula is not alone in this; over the last three years, the U.S. economy has added 140,000 jobs in the arts and entertainment sector, as many communities recognize the benefits of a thriving artistic community.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt used to be that communities invested in the arts solely as a local amenity that produces value in and of itself. In times of tight budgets, this justification has not always been enough to continue support for the arts; however, research has found there are many ways in which the arts economically benefit communities. A framework for thinking about these benefits can be found in what is known as \u201cnew growth theory,\u201d which is based on the idea that individuals, firms and governments make a conscious choice to invest in skills, knowledge acquisition and in innovative activities. With investment in skills and innovation comes the development of technology that enhances growth, and technological changes have been found to be responsible for most of the long-run growth in income per capita. Further, there are spillovers of knowledge between firms and individuals that are near each other, leading to clusters of knowledge-based industries.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECommunities have begun to realize that spending on arts and cultural activities is another form of innovative investment that can clearly play a role in economic growth. These investments generate short -term benefits, for example those who attend arts events spend money in a community on both the event and related activities such as going to a local restaurant, generating a multiplier effect on local employment and income and leading to increased tax revenue. In the longer run, an active arts scene in a city can create a quality of life that attracts highly skilled workers, raising the productivity of the local area and fostering innovation. The arts themselves also generate income for workers while the spillover effects from clustering of arts activities can increase the productivity of the workers in a given artistic endeavor and perhaps even expanding across various disciplines, creating a \u201cculture of innovation\u201d in a city.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe precise ways in which the arts can lead to higher economic growth and the magnitudes of these effects are topics that continue to be analyzed. For example, last year the National Endowment for the Arts and the Brookings Institution held a daylong conference entitled \u201c\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.nea.gov\/research\/Brookings\/index.html\u0022\u003EThe Arts, New Growth Theory and Economic Development\u003C\/a\u003E,\u201d at which a dozen papers were presented on various topics in this area.

Along with our agency partners \u2013 the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Small Business Administration \u2013 we are awarding $7 million in grants and investments that comprise the first funding phase of the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe communities selected as winners by the Department of Commerce represent 17 different states. They have developed cutting-edge plans that capitalize on these communities\u0027 comparative advantages as a place to do business. These plans make investments in public goods, and encourage collaboration between multiple public and private entities to expand the area\u0027s commercial appeal to investors. In total, the first funding phase of the program provides 44 planning grants and investments.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe IMCP stemmed from the recognized need to effectively accelerate manufacturing investment in the United States. Too often, communities have relied on the practice of \u201csmokestack chasing\u201d to attract investment, in which communities will offer tax breaks and subsidies to attract the attention of a single firm. Economists have found this approach often yields a low return for taxpayer investment. The Obama administration seeks to encourage and assist American communities to not merely make efforts to attract individual investments but instead to transform themselves into manufacturing hubs that that draw all kinds of businesses.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGrants and investments awarded in 2013 will help communities undertake the strategic planning necessary to compete for the IMCP Challenge being launched in fall 2013 and awarded in the spring of 2014. \u00a0In the 2014 Challenge competition, the Administration will designate stand-out \u201cManufacturing Communities\u201d and give them an advantage in securing grant money through programs offered by 10 federal departments and agencies across the government. Moreover, top \u201cManufacturing Communities\u201d may receive large IMCP Challenge grants and investments to finance \u2013 in partnership with industry and localities \u2013 substantial economic development investments such as workforce training, business parks or incubators, or infrastructure.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to make this transformation a reality, the IMCP allows American communities to capitalize on U.S. economic strengths in order to be a magnet for investors.

The aptly named Green Button Initiative has been a great success - 12 million households had access to the Green Button last year, which is expected to rise to 27 million in the near future. Entrepreneurs have already started to save consumers money and build value for themselves by using this data. The Green Button Initiative was built on a technical standard which was developed by a public-private partnership supported by the Commerce Department\u0027s National Institute of Standards and Technology.

In fact, each day, the United States conducts $3 billion dollars in trade with Canada and Mexico.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYesterday, at the North American Competitiveness and Innovation Conference (NACIC) in La Jolla, Calif., U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker met with her Mexican and Canadian counterparts, Canadian Minister of International Trade Ed Fast and Mexican Secretary of Economy Ildefonso Guajardo, to discuss how all three countries can continue to work together to promote mutual economic growth and prosperity.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a \u003Ca href=\u0022\/\/www.commerce.gov\/news\/press-releases\/2013\/10\/joint-us-canada-mexico-statement-strengthening-trade-and-economic\u0022\u003Ejoint statement\u003C\/a\u003E, the ministers pledged to work together to keep the region competitive and help North American businesses and workers succeed through enhanced regulatory cooperation and coordinated efforts to facilitate increased trade, including the ongoing Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENorth America is already one of the most attractive places for businesses to invest and create jobs. More than 460 million consumers live in the region. Combined, the U.S., Canada and Mexico account for one-quarter of the world\u2019s GDP. North America is a source of abundant and affordable energy, is home to a skilled workforce, and has made tremendous investments in research and development.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe United States, Canada and Mexico also invest in one another. U.S. foreign direct investment in Canada and Mexico was $449.3 billion in 2012, up 9 percent from 2010. Canada and Mexico\u2019s foreign direct investment in the U.S. was $243 billion in 2012, up 9.3 percent from 2010.

The program has invested in 109 projects in the last three years and saved more than $32 million. I am currently revamping the program to streamline and improve metrics, objectives, performance and the harvesting of ideas.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are several overarching themes within my current responsibilities that relate to the President\u2019s blueprint for America \u2014 innovation, efficiency, saving money, avoiding costs, streamlining processes, and creating projects that add strategic value to the organization. By spurring innovation and improving operational efficiency, my program helps government run more efficiently and do more with less.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my varied career since joining the Department of Commerce in 1998, I have worked in five of the Census Bureau\u2019s12 regional offices as well as the headquarters building in Suitland, Md. My previous position \u2014 director of the Dallas Regional Office \u2014 was the most challenging, as at the peak of operations during the 2010 Census, it had 111,000 employees in 51 local census offices. I led the enumeration of more than 33 million people while dealing with 45 congressional districts and four of the 10 most populous cities in the country.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI was born in Uruguay and immigrated to the United States at the age of eight. I was raised in New York City, but I have been fortunate to live in various places around the country, which helped ratchet down the big city experience. I was very proud of my heritage when I became the first-ever foreign-born regional director of the Census Bureau. Still, I keep searching for another Uruguayan in the Commerce Department.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI was one of the founders of the Census Latino Employee Organization in 2004, and I continue to assist their efforts to this day. I volunteer, as I have had for years, with the National Kidney Foundation, and I try to give back by informally mentoring multiple employees throughout the country.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHispanic Heritage Month serves as a reminder of what our diversity goals at Commerce should be; that we should create an organization reflective of our nation. We can be better public servants if we strive for diversity not only because we will better understand our customers but also because we will be able to harness one of our country\u2019s greatest assets.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI always advise young Hispanics to put the Commerce Department at the top of their federal job wish list because while we may not be the sexiest agency (there will never be a TV show or movie about us), the depth and breadth of our activities allow for tremendous creativity and a true fulfillment of practically any career choice. Working for the Department of Commerce can be a job, but it can also be an opening to so many bureaus and activities that you are bound to be able to find a place to make a happy career.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy career-long commitment to diversity garnered me the Department of Commerce Equal Employment Opportunity Award in 2004 and the Diversity Champion Award in 2006. My commitment to innovation earned me the Director\u2019s Award for Innovation in 2012 and the Commerce Department Gold Medal in 2013.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI hold a bachelor\u2019s degree in military history from the City University of New York, a master\u2019s certificate in leadership from the University of Maryland and a master\u2019s certificate in project management from Georgetown University. I will graduate next month from the Commerce Department\u2019s Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program (SESCDP), during which I helped develop the strategic planning process for the Department and completed a four-month detail at the Department of Education to assist them with performance management.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy two favorite quotes come from Gen. George S. Patton and Groucho Marx. Patton said: \u201cWe herd sheep, we drive cattle, we lead people. Lead me, follow me or get out of my way.\u201d Marx said: \u201cA black cat crossing your path signifies that the animal is going somewhere.\u201d These quotes remind me that we always need to focus on what we are doing, and the other one that we should always remember to laugh.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","image":[{"id":"78","created":"0","href":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/sites\/commerce.gov\/files\/media\/images\/2013\/gabriel-sanchez.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"86174","width":"314","height":"350","alt":"Photo of Gabriel Sanchez, Improving Operational Efficiency Program Manager, U.S. Census Bureau","title":"Spotlight on Commerce: Gabriel Sanchez, Improving Operational Efficiency Program Manager, U.S. Census Bureau","caption":"Spotlight on Commerce: Gabriel Sanchez, Improving Operational Efficiency Program Manager, U.S. Census Bureau\r\n","styles":{"thumbnail":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/sites\/commerce.gov\/files\/styles\/thumbnail\/public\/media\/images\/2013\/gabriel-sanchez.jpg?itok=zeyoWvS7","medium":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/sites\/commerce.gov\/files\/styles\/medium\/public\/media\/images\/2013\/gabriel-sanchez.jpg?itok=v3hNDtVq","large":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/sites\/commerce.gov\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/media\/images\/2013\/gabriel-sanchez.jpg?itok=W5l6nIip"}}],"video":null,"categories":[{"id":"156","href":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/categories\/innovation","label":"Innovation"},{"id":"167","href":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/categories\/about-us-department-commerce","label":"About the U.S. Department of Commerce"}],"tags":[{"id":"169","href":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/tags\/hispanic-heritage-month","label":"Hispanic Heritage Month"},[],[],{"id":"356","href":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/tags\/spotlight-commerce","label":"Spotlight on Commerce"}],"admin_officials":null,"orgs":[{"id":"5","href":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/doc\/us-census-bureau","label":"U.S. Census Bureau"}],"audience":null,"galleries":null,"documents":null,"related":null,"created":"1383145613","updated":"1443215351"},{"id":136,"label":"Redesigning Commerce.gov","self":"https:\/\/api.commerce.gov\/api\/blogs\/136","href":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/news\/blog\/2013\/10\/redesigning-commercegov","post_date":"1383141600","teaser":"After having the same look and feel on our website since 2010, Commerce.gov is embarking on a fresh redesign to put the user in the driver seat.

I was very ignorant of proper winter clothing techniques but eventually learned. I earned my B.A. in physics and meteorology and worked on my M. Eng in Engineering Physics there before moving on to the University of Michigan where I earned my PhD in Atmospheric and Space Science. My first foray into public service was as a NAS\/NRC research associate at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center and then at the Naval Research Laboratory. I grew more enthusiastic about NWS with the modernization period that ended in the late 1990s and switched to NOAA.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs early as junior high school, I was influenced by Dr. Jos\u00e9 A. Col\u00f3n, then director of WFO San Juan, which also doubled as the National Hurricane Center-East. Discovering another Puerto Rican in charge of this office was a positive surprise in and of itself. Further inspiring me was learning that he had switched medical school to complete a doctorate at the University of Chicago in the 1950s, when that was the likely premier institution for advanced meteorological study. Another colleague of his, Professor T. Krishnmamurty of Florida State fame, came from the same program. Dr. Col\u00f3n did subsequent research in tropical meteorology in India and, later, in PR. I had the chance to observe Dr. Col\u00f3n work on computing tropical cyclone trajectories on top of various charts and satellite images, using an advanced hand calculator (very expensive in those days), thus bringing forth the idea that these systems were calculable and subject to physics and mathematical techniques. Therefore, I wanted such knowledge as well, motivating me to study meteorology, mathematics, and physics. Later on, Dr. Col\u00f3n gave me some advice about where to study meteorology, becoming the only real guidance I had on my educational plans. He had a distinctive way of thinking about scientific problems, turning a key in his hand, pausing for seconds, perhaps longer, and then furnishing a thoughtful idea. He also took time to give me advice on how to analyze weather data I was gathering at my house, and introduced me to the concept of statistical comparison when I was participating in a year-long urban heat study in junior high school. Later on, with his help, I had the chance to fly into Hurricane Frances.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHispanic Heritage Month is a time to reflect on Hispanic culture and history and celebrate the presence and contribution of Hispanics in the U.S. I celebrate by helping organize cultural and professional activities in the agency as well as in spreading the word. Ultimately, to me it is an everyday celebration with others who enjoy cultural perspectives. I would advise young Hispanics to master written communication skills, quantitative thinking, and, especially, to be mindful of differences in the way Hispanics and non-Hispanics talk about themselves. Hispanics can value self-deprecatory humor, for instance, that others could misunderstand. A simple joke can quickly become a hindrance to open communication. Also, it is vital that we learn to collaborate freely and generously to succeed in the 21st century.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n","image":null,"video":null,"categories":[{"id":"167","href":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/categories\/about-us-department-commerce","label":"About the U.S. Department of Commerce"}],"tags":[{"id":"169","href":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/tags\/hispanic-heritage-month","label":"Hispanic Heritage Month"},{"id":"150","href":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/tags\/science-technology-engineering-and-math","label":"Science, Technology, Engineering and Math"},{"id":"356","href":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/tags\/spotlight-commerce","label":"Spotlight on Commerce"}],"admin_officials":null,"orgs":[{"id":"9","href":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/doc\/national-oceanic-and-atmospheric-administration","label":"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}],"audience":null,"galleries":null,"documents":null,"related":null,"created":"1383931416","updated":"1508450924"},{"id":161,"label":"Secretary Penny Pritzker Returns to Chicago for First Official Visit","self":"https:\/\/api.commerce.gov\/api\/blogs\/161","href":"https:\/\/www.commerce.gov\/news\/blog\/2013\/11\/secretary-penny-pritzker-returns-chicago-first-official-visit","post_date":"1383874200","teaser":"Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker returned to Chicago yesterday, making her first visit to her hometown in her official capacity as head of the Department.

The multiple-vortex storm impacted an area 35 kilometers (22 miles) long, destroyed some 8,000 structures in its path and killed 161 people. This makes it the single deadliest tornado in the United States in the 63 years that official records have been kept.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the majority of cases, the study found that regardless of construction type, buildings did not adequately protect occupants and that Joplin residents had limited access to underground or tornado-resistant shelters. The majority of deaths (135 or 83.8 percent) were caused by impacts associated with building failure. Virtually all of the buildings in which people died were affected by wind speeds equivalent to an EF-3 tornado or higher on the Enhanced Fujita scale.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMultiple factors contributed to a delayed or incomplete response by people in the tornado\u0027s path, including lack of awareness of the tornado\u0027s approach, confusion about or distrust of the emergency messages prior to the tornado\u0027s arrival, and an inability to perceive risk due to the conflicting information. While outdoor siren systems prompted many residents to seek further information about whether or not there was a true hazard, people were often confused by multiple information sources.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBased on findings from the investigation, NIST developed 16 recommendations for improving how buildings and shelters are designed, constructed and maintained in tornado-prone regions; and for improving the emergency communications that warn of imminent threat from tornadoes.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe key recommendation proposed in the report is \u0022the development and adoption of nationally accepted performance-based standards for the tornado-resistant design of buildings and infrastructure to ensure the resiliency of communities to tornado hazards.\u0022 This includes a call for designing and constructing essential buildings\u2014such as hospitals and emergency operations centers\u2014and infrastructure to remain operational in the event of a tornado. Additionally, the report\u0027s authors recommend the development of methods that will ensure all building components and systems meet the proposed performance objectives.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe report also recommends uniform national guidelines be developed that enable communities to create the safest and most effective public sheltering strategies. Shelters, the report states, should be installed in new and existing multi-family residential and commercial buildings, schools and in buildings with assembly occupancies (such as theaters and places of worship) located in tornado hazard areas.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso needed are nationally accepted codes and standards, as well as uniform guidance for clear, consistent and accurate emergency communications, according to the report. This will require the collaboration of emergency managers, the NWS and the media to develop and execute a plan to ensure that appropriate and timely warning information improves the situational awareness of the people who would be affected by an event, including emergency responders.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe NIST investigation of the Joplin tornado was conducted under the provisions of the National Construction Safety Team (NCST) Act. The act gives NIST the responsibility for conducting fact-finding investigations of building failures that resulted in substantial loss of life or that posed significant potential for substantial loss of life.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Joplin tornado investigation builds on a partnership between the agency\u0027s Disaster and Failure Studies Program and the interagency National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program.
